# React Native Assignment 1

This is my first React Native project made with the React Native CLI for the first assignment.  
I set up the environment on my Mac, installed Node, Watchman, JDK, and Xcode, and got the app running in the iPhone simulator.  

The app itself is very simple – it shows a small counter and a message that changes when you press a button.  
I also tested debugging with Chrome DevTools by setting breakpoints and checking variable values while the app was running.  

Everything works fine now, and I’ve added screenshots to show the setup, the app running, and how the debugger looks.
